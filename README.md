idris101
========

This is a learning project by a group of people interested in learning [the Idris language](http://www.idris-lang.org/), a a functional programming language with [dependent types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type).

The goal would be to have [the bowling kata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataBowling) written in the Idris language by the time we go to [BuildStuff 2015](http://buildstuff.lt/), probably November 2015.

People that want to join need to send a pull request for this readme and add themselves, their github account name and their timezone.

You can do his by editing the file here: https://github.com/ToJans/idris101/edit/master/README.md

* Andrew Jones - @andrewscj - UTC+0 (DST)
* Tom Janssens - @ToJans - UTC+1 (DST)
* [name] - [username] - [timezone + daylight saving time or not]

Please order this list by timezones.

Depending on the number of people interested in joining we might need to figure out how to properly co-op, but that's something we can figure out later. For now we'd first need to know how many people want to join us.
